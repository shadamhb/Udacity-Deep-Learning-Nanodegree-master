# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-master
This repository's purpose in to document my projects submission to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)

## project1: Predicting Bike Sharing Data
I implemented a simple neural network with numpy. this was a good exercise to understand how forward path and back propagation work in neural network.

## project2: Dog Breed Classifier
I implemented a CNN with Keras to classify dog breed.

## project3: Generate TV Scripts
I generated TV scripts from existing scripts dataset using RNN.

## project4: Generate Faces
I generated human face images using GANs.
